    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
         when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
         It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
           sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
            Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
            Where does it come from?
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
            literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
            College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
             and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum 
             comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
              written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
               of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

       <p> Why do we use it?
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when 
        looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution 
        of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
         desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
          search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have 
          evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
          Nereden Gelir?
        Yaygın inancın tersine, Lorem Ipsum rastgele sözcüklerden oluşmaz. Kökleri M.Ö. 45 tarihinden bu yana klasik 
Latin edebiyatına kadar uzanan 2000 yıllık bir geçmişi vardır. 
Virginia'daki Hampden-Sydney College'dan Latince profesörü Richard McClintock, bir Lorem Ipsum pasajında geçen 
ve anlaşılması en güç sözcüklerden biri olan 'consectetur' sözcüğünün klasik edebiyattaki örneklerini incelediğinde 
kesin bir kaynağa ulaşmıştır. Lorm Ipsum, Çiçero tarafından M.Ö. 45 tarihinde kaleme alınan "de Finibus Bonorum et 
Malorum" (İyi ve Kötünün Uç Sınırları) eserinin 1.10.32 ve 1.10.33 sayılı bölümlerinden gelmektedir. Bu kitap, ahlak 
kuramı üzerine bir tezdir ve Rönesans döneminde çok popüler olmuştur. Lorem Ipsum pasajının ilk satırı olan "Lorem ipsum
 dolor sit amet" 1.10.32 sayılı bölümdeki bir satırdan gelmektedir.

1500'lerden beri kullanılmakta olan standard Lorem Ipsum metinleri ilgilenenler için yeniden üretilmiştir. Çiçero
 tarafından yazılan 1.10.32 ve 1.10.33 bölümleri de 1914 H. Rackham çevirisinden alınan İngilizce sürümleri eşliğinde
  özgün biçiminden yeniden üretilmiştir.
